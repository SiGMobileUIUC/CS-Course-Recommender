The lessons are reinforced via a series of topic-driven lectures, coding assignments, related paper readings, exams and in-class discussions. Students will learn to analyze current interactions between attackers and defenders on machine learning and therefore develop an understanding of the principles on trustworthy machine learning which is an emerging and important topic. Students will be required to finish three related homework projects, including 1) developing a machine learning classifier, 2) designing adversarial attacks against the built classifier, and 3) developing defenses to improve the robustness of the trained classifier against designed attacks.

Time permitting, we will also discuss computational problems in microbiome analysis, protein function and structure prediction, genome assembly, and even historical linguistics. Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations in these areas, read the current literature, and do a team research project. The course is designed for doctoral students in computer science, computer engineering, bioengineering, mathematics, and statistics, and does not depend on any prior background in biology. The technical material will depend on discrete algorithms, graph theory, simulations, and probabilistic analysis of algorithms.
